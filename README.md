A combination of span task and n-back

Here a study that claim that n-back task improve working memory in 30% and memory Span task improve 15%. What if we do a combination of the two tasks?

The technique consists in using the major system http://www.memory-sports.com/blog/memory-techniques/the-major-system/ and the eidetic memory.

1) convert the first 8 digits in 4 words. First you would have to be able to read 100 digits (50 words) in 40 seconds.

2) Then you use the eidetic memory to see the last 8 digits or less according your personal configuration. You need to expand the peripheral vision.

3)The 2 digit selected in binary are visualized example: (82: phone). If you have time you can do an association with the previous 2 digits. (example phone hit a fish)

Example with 12 digits

convert to words  eidetic

     23 44 55 23 45
         |       13
         |
     00 11 00 00 00
                 00
                 
You practice speed reading, Major System, Eidetic Memory, working memory, mental image visualization, n-back and spatial memory.    

Mr n-back have support for Tricky Stymuls (Interference)

trying to emulate n +-1/(n-back+1) instead of novel/ totally random stimuli


Increased parietal activity after training of interference control
High interference led to partial improvements in the Attention Network Test (ANT
This suggest that training on an interference control task leads to higher electrophysiological activity in the parietal cortex, which may be related to improvements in processing speed, attentional control, or both.

Installation

To install Mrnback you need to put the files in this Github repository in a folder on a PHP server (you can use XAMP,WAMP, MAMP). The App not uses databases or other add-on. You can test it by open the file "inifinity.php" in the broweser.
